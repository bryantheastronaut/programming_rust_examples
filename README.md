##  Learning Rust with a book!
![Mandel Example from Chapter 2](https://github.com/bryantheastronaut/programming_rust_examples/blob/master/mandel.png)

^^^ This cool looking image was made from a Rust program in chapter two!

These are just the examples from the Programming Rust book by Jim Blandy & Jason Orendorff. I highly recommend it so far. [You can find it here](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Rust-Fast-Systems-Development/dp/1491927283/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1514780728&sr=8-1&keywords=programming+rust)
